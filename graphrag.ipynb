Expired stale food can be hazardous to life and safety.\\n3.  **Unfair Trade Practice:** Serving expired stale food can also be considered an \"unfair trade practice\" which includes \"permitting the sale or supply of goods intended to be used... knowing or having reason to believe that the goods do not comply with the standards prescribed by the competent authority relating to performance... as are necessary to prevent or reduce the risk of injury to the person using the goods\" [Definition: unfair trade practice (iv)].\\n4.  **Product Liability Action:** If the expired stale food caused you \"harm\" (which includes personal injury, illness, mental agony, or damage to property), you can file a \"product liability action\" [Definition: product liability action] before a District Commission, State Commission, or National Commission for claiming compensation for the harm caused [Definition: product liability action (35)].\\n\\nThe \"District Commission\" is the appropriate forum to admit and proceed with such a complaint [Relevant Section: procedure on admission of complaint (1)].'"
