       "'As an expert lawyer specialized in Indian consumer protection law, and based *strictly and exclusively* on the sections of the law you have provided, here is the answer to your question:\\n\\nBased solely on the provided sections, there is no explicit provision that directly states a consumer can \"sue\" a hotel specifically for serving \"expired stale food\" in the sense of initiating a civil action for compensation or specific redress directly linked to this act.\\n\\nHowever, let\\'s examine the relevant parts:\\n\\n1.  **Product Containing Adulterant:**\\n    The provided text states: \"Whoever, by himself or by any other person on his behalf, manufactures for sale or stores or sells or distributes or imports any product containing an adulterant shall be punished...\"\\n    The **Explanation** defines \"adulterant\" as \"any material including extraneous matter which is employed or used for making a product unsafe.\"\\n\\n    If the \"expired stale food,\" due to its staleness or expiration, has become **unsafe** (e.g., through bacterial growth, spoilage leading to harmful substances), it could potentially be argued that it contains \"material including extraneous matter which is employed or used for making a product unsafe.\" If this interpretation holds, then the act of selling or storing such food by the hotel would constitute an offense under this section.\\n\\n    The consequences for such an act are clearly defined as criminal punishments:\\n    *   Imprisonment (from six months to life, depending on the injury caused).\\n    *   Fines (from one lakh rupees to not less than ten lakh rupees, depending on the injury).\\n    *   Suspension or cancellation of the licence of the person convicted.\\n\\n    **Important Note:** This section primarily describes a criminal offense and the penalties to be imposed by the state. It outlines the punishment for the offender but does not explicitly detail a consumer\\'s right to initiate a *civil suit* for damages or compensation directly against the hotel for personal harm suffered due to consuming such food, based *solely* on the text provided here. While such an offense could form the basis of a consumer complaint, the provided text does not outline the mechanism for the consumer to \"sue\" for individual redress under *this specific section*.\\n\\n2.  **Spurious Goods:**\\n    The text also mentions punishment for manufacturing, storing, selling, etc., \"any spurious goods.\" However, the provided sections **do not include a definition** of \"spurious goods.\" Without a definition, it is not possible to determine if \"expired stale food\" would fall under this category based strictly on the text you\\'ve provided.\\n\\n3.  **Rule-Making Powers (including Filing Complaints):**\\n    Sections (p) and (q) under the rule-making powers mention:\\n    *   \"(p) the manner of electronically filing complaint under the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 35;\"\\n    *   \"(q) the fee, electronic form and the manner of payment of fee for filing complaint under sub-section (2) of section 35;\"\\n    These clauses indicate that there are provisions for consumers to file complaints and specify how rules can be made for the *manner* and *fees* for doing so. However, these sections do not define the *grounds* for such complaints or specifically state that \"serving expired stale food\" is an actionable ground for a complaint leading to a \"suit\" for compensation. They merely refer to the procedural aspects of complaint filing.\\n\\n**In summary:**\\n\\nBased *only* on the sections you have provided:\\n*   The act of serving expired stale food, if it makes the product **unsafe**, *could* potentially be classified as selling a \"product containing an adulterant.\" This would subject the hotel to **criminal penalties** (imprisonment, fines, license actions) as described in the provided text.\\n*   However, these sections **do not explicitly grant you, as a consumer, the right to directly \"sue\" the hotel for compensation or civil damages for serving expired stale food.** While a criminal prosecution might occur if the food is deemed adulterated, the provided text does not define the *mechanism for you to personally sue for redress* in this scenario.\\n\\nMy advice is strictly limited to the provided text, which mainly outlines criminal offenses and rule-making powers, without explicitly detailing consumer civil remedies for this specific grievance.'"
